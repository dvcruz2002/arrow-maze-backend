# AI Usage Log: Branch Workflow Setup

## Task / Problem

Configure the repository branch workflow after `main` and `develop` were created.

## Tool and Model

Codex / GPT-5.

## Prompt Used

The user asked Codex to configure branches for the client and backend repositories and clarify what must be set in GitHub before starting the workflow.

## Result Obtained

Updated worktree scripts and agent/contribution documentation so feature work starts from `origin/develop`, feature PRs target `develop`, and only human-approved release PRs target `main`.

## Team Modifications Pending Human Review

- Confirm whether the team wants `develop` or `main` as the GitHub default branch.
- Configure branch protection rules in GitHub for `main` and `develop`.

## Lessons / Limitations

When a project uses both `main` and `develop`, agent instructions must be explicit about PR targets to avoid accidental release-branch work.
