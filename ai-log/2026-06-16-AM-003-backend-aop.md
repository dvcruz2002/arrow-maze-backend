# AI Usage Log: AM-003 Backend AOP

## Task / Problem

Resolve AM-003 / MAZ-74 by adding explicit backend AOP wrappers for application-service logging and transaction boundaries without contaminating domain or framework layers.

## Tool and Model

Codex / GPT-5.

## Prompt Used

The user asked Codex to implement Linear ticket MAZ-74 and follow the correct workflow, including pull request creation.

## Result Obtained

- Added a generic `UseCase` contract for application decorators.
- Added `UseCaseLoggingDecorator` to log use-case start, finish, duration, and sanitized errors.
- Added `TransactionDecorator` to wrap application use cases with a `UnitOfWork` transaction boundary.
- Added the `UnitOfWork` application port.
- Added `sanitizeLogContext` to redact sensitive log values such as passwords, tokens, secrets, credentials, and authorization data.
- Added application tests for successful logging, sanitized error logging, transaction execution, transaction error propagation, and context sanitization.

## Team Modifications Pending Human Review

- Confirm whether all future application services should implement the generic `UseCase<Input, Output>` contract.
- Confirm the concrete `UnitOfWork` implementation once persistence is approved.
- Confirm whether stronger structured logging requirements are needed after AM-002 standardizes error classes.

## Lessons / Limitations

AM-003 can be implemented independently from HTTP error handling by keeping the AOP wrappers entirely in the application layer. The concrete transaction implementation remains intentionally deferred until persistence infrastructure is approved.
