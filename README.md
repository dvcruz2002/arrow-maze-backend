# Arrow Maze Backend

REST API for Arrow Maze, built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express
- TypeScript
- Swagger / OpenAPI
- Jest
- Supertest
- Docker
- ESLint
- Husky
- Commitlint

## Architecture Overview

The backend follows Clean Architecture.

```txt
framework -> infrastructure -> application -> domain
```

Business rules belong in `src/domain`. Use cases and ports belong in `src/application`. Database, JWT, hashing, and logging implementations belong in `src/infrastructure`. Express, routes, controllers, middleware, Swagger, and server bootstrap belong in `src/framework`.

## Academic Compliance

This repository must stay aligned with Section 6 and Section 7 of the project statement.

Section 6 requires a clear, professional, and updated `README.md` covering project description, architecture, design patterns, SOLID principles, AOP strategy, local execution, tests, contribution workflow, diagrams, and AI usage documentation.

Section 7 requires every significant AI-assisted intervention to be documented in `AI_USAGE.md` and/or `ai-log/`, including the tool, prompt, generated result, team modifications, and lessons learned. AI-assisted code must be reviewed, tested, and understood by the team before integration.

## Design Patterns

| Pattern | Layer | Key class(es) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repository | infrastructure | `PgUserRepository`, `PgLeaderboardRepository`, `PgProgressRepository` |
| Adapter | infrastructure | All `Pg*` repos, `BcryptPasswordHasher`, `JwtTokenService` |
| Factory | domain | `UserFactory` |
| Unit of Work | infrastructure | `PgUnitOfWork` |
| AOP Decorator | application | `UseCaseLoggingDecorator`, `TransactionDecorator` |
| Template Method | application | `UseCase<Input,Output>` contract |
| Aggregate Root | domain | `User`, `Leaderboard`, `PlayerProgress` |
| Value Object | domain | All VOs (UserId, Email, ProgressId, LevelScore, …) |
| Domain Event | domain | `UserRegistered`, `LevelCompletedEvent`, `LeaderboardUpdatedEvent` |
| Merge Policy | domain | `ProgressMergePolicy` |

## SOLID Principles

| Principle | Where |
| --- | --- |
| **S** — Single Responsibility | Each use case does one thing; controllers only delegate to use cases |
| **O** — Open/Closed | `UseCase<I,O>` interface extended by decorators without modifying use cases |
| **L** — Liskov Substitution | All repository implementations are interchangeable behind their port interfaces |
| **I** — Interface Segregation | `IProgressRepository`, `IDomainEventBus`, `IPasswordHasher` are narrow, separate ports |
| **D** — Dependency Inversion | Framework layer injects concrete adapters into application use cases via constructor |

## AOP Strategy

Cross-cutting concerns are handled in the application layer with two decorators:

- `UseCaseLoggingDecorator` — logs start, finish, duration, and sanitized error context without modifying use case code.
- `TransactionDecorator` — wraps any use case in a `PgUnitOfWork` BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK without the use case knowing about transactions.

`sanitizeLogContext` strips passwords, tokens, secrets, credentials, and authorization fields before any log is written. No PII or credentials are ever logged.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- npm 10+
- PostgreSQL 16 (local or Docker)

### Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values (never commit `.env`):

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/arrow_maze
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-here
PORT=3000
```

### Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # ts-node watch mode
```

Apply the DB migrations manually before first run:

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f src/infrastructure/database/migrations/001_create_users.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f src/infrastructure/database/migrations/002_create_leaderboard.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f src/infrastructure/database/migrations/003_create_player_progress.sql
```

### Swagger UI

```
GET http://localhost:3000/docs
```

The API exposes:

```
GET  /health
GET  /docs
POST /auth/register
POST /auth/login
POST /leaderboard/scores
GET  /leaderboard/:levelId
GET  /progress/me
POST /progress/levels/:levelId/complete
PUT  /progress/sync
```

## Quality Commands

```bash
npm run lint           # ESLint with architecture guardrails
npm run typecheck      # TypeScript strict check, no emit
npm test               # Jest (all suites)
npm run test:coverage  # Jest with coverage report in ./coverage
npm run build          # tsc compile to dist/
npm run verify         # lint + typecheck + test:coverage (run before PR)
```

## Architecture Guardrails

Clean Architecture boundaries are enforced by ESLint through `import/no-restricted-paths`.

Current guarded rules:

- `src/domain` must not import `src/application`, `src/infrastructure`, or `src/framework`.
- `src/application` must not import `src/infrastructure` or `src/framework`.
- `src/infrastructure` must not import `src/framework`.

If a ticket requires changing these boundaries, stop and ask the team before editing code.

## Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

## CI/CD

Pull requests run install, lint, typecheck, tests with coverage, and build through GitHub Actions.

## Contributing

See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## AI Usage

Every significant AI-assisted task must create an entry in `ai-log/`. The final summary is maintained in `AI_USAGE.md`.
